## Travel Recommendation Project

#### This repository contains a project developed as part of the **JavaScript Programming Essentials course by IBM**.
#### In this project, I strengthened my fundamentals of **JavaScript programming** by building a simple travel recommendation application. 
##### The main concepts applied include:
- JavaScript variables, data types, and operators
- Conditional logic and control flow
- Functions and basic program structure
- Working with arrays and objects
- Handling user input and dynamic content
- Basic problem-solving using JavaScript logic
